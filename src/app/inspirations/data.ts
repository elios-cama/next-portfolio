    detailedContent: {
      overview: "Untitled is an app fundamentally built for music creators, designed to be a fluid, intuitive space for their work-in-progress tracks. It stands out by valuing the creative process itself, offering a sanctuary for unreleased music that traditional tools or streaming platforms don't provide. It's a powerful example of building deep, vertical workflows into a simple, mobile-first experience.",

        {
          title: "Design That Feels Like an OS for Creativity",
          description: "The app is designed to be powerful yet simple, like a mini operating system for music creation. It takes complex tasks (organizing, editing, collaborating) and presents them in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming, fluidly integrating different tools (\"Notes, Edit, Record\" sections)."
        },
        {
          title: "Valuing the \"Work-in-Progress\"",
          description: "Untitled's core principle is treating unreleased music (\"the other 9000 tracks\") as precious and valuable. It's a space where music doesn't have to be \"finished\" for a streaming platform but can simply exist and be listened to, shared with friends, or worked on without pressure."

          title: "Building for the Craft & the Crafter",
          description: "Born from musicians, the app deeply understands and optimizes for the artist's workflow and emotional connection to their music. It's built for the craft, aiming to be the \"Frank Ocean of software\" â€“ high quality and respected by creators at all levels."

        {
          title: "Seamless Workflow Integration",
          description: "It aims to be the starting point (\"the spark\") and staying point for music creation, slowly integrating tools like AI stem splitting and editing directly into the mobile app. This vertical integration challenges the fragmented traditional music software landscape."

        {
          title: "Creating New \"Atomic Units\" of Music",
          description: "Beyond finished songs, Untitled enables sharing snippets, WIP tracks, and the process itself as forms of content and connection. This challenges how music is traditionally consumed and distributed, creating a new kind of \"currency\" or engagement around unfinished work."

      overview: "Retro is a refreshing counterpoint to mainstream social media. Instead of chasing infinite scroll and algorithmic attention, it focuses on being a private, low-pressure weekly photo journal shared exclusively with close friends and family. It proves that social platforms can be built ethically and beautifully, prioritizing user well-being and genuine connection.",

          title: "The \"Anti-Social\" Social Principle",
          description: "By focusing on a private \"Friends Only\" model, making likes/friend lists private, and removing caption pressure, Retro deliberately removes the anxiety and comparison inherent in public social media. It encourages authentic sharing over performance."
